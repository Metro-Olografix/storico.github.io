         Reaching the TiG'97 party-place
         is very simple because it is only 700m far away from the central
         railway station. When you exit from the station, you will see,
         in front of you, the city center. You will notice a lot of
         flags representing the italian railway company logo. A lot of taxis
         will be in front of you! You must go left and take the first turning on the
         left. Go straigth along that road (it is a sort of tunnel. You will walk
         under the first floor of the station). At the end of this road you will be
         just in front of "Via Aremogna". Your path is summarized by the
         green arrow on the map.<BR CLEAR>
         <IMG SRC="Images/map2.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10>When you are on "Via Aremogna"
         you must go straight along that road. You will notice a restaurant on the left
         (it is called "Trattoria Fernando"), just before the crossing. Once you have
         arrived at the crossing, take the road that is in front of "Via Aremogna".
         It is "Via Passolanciano". You must go straight along that road until you
         reach another crossing. At this point you should notice a newspapers stand and
         a fuel station on the right. Turn right and you will be on "Via Rigopiano".
         This is the road where the party place is located. You must walk until you will
         see the party place on the right. The green arrow shows your path.
         <H2>Coming by bus</H2>
         If you carry a lot of stuff (computers and so on), you might also come to the
         party place by bus. Once you have arrived to the station, you can
         notice the bus stop in the big area just in front of the station exit.
         You must take the bus number 9. It will leave you just in front of the party place.
         Ask to the bus-driver when to get off.
