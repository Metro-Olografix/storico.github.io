         We have decided to extend TiG'97 with some events that don't
         belong to a standard demo-party. TiG'97 will host some conferences
         about various interesting topics. Everyone can partecipate to those
         conference by listening or speaking. The conferences are opened
         to everyone. You can take the microphone and say whatever you want.
         There will be technical conferences and lighter conferences about
         non-specifical topics. All the conferences-related material will
         be released as party-productions.
