         Hey?!? What's a demo party?<BR>
         (<B>Cerin0</B>) Well, it's a party for computer-addicted people, where strange people
         throws hard-disks, drinking a lot of Coke... It's a surreal place that sometime pops up
         somewhere...<BR><BR>
         <CENTER><B>Welcome to the official site of the most important italian event of the year :<BR>
         The Italian Gathering '97</B><BR> (also known as TiG'97)</CENTER><BR>
         This is the second attempt to organize a quite-real demo-party in Italy. The first one was made
         the last year with TiG'96. We got a lot
         of feedback from that party and so we have decided to make it bigger and better!<BR>
         Thanks to the care of the organizers of the TiG'96 and a lot of other people, this year we
         have the chance to do a big demo party. TiG'96 was an experiment. TiG'97 will be a reality.
         Take a look to the <A HREF="organizing.html" TARGET="MAIN">organizing</A> section for more
         info about the people who worked at this project. This year we have a lot of
         features, prizes and a wide range of real compos. There will be concerts, conferences
         and internet connections. And above all we have a whorty party-place : an entire
         sporting center! It wasn't possible to organize a multi-day party (we are aware that a REAL
         party cannot last only one day), but we think that TiG'97 will be a big step towards the
         making of a multi day party... Will it be TiG'98? Who knows? Surely it depends on the feedback
         we will get this year. So, get your PC, go to the nearest train station, buy a ticket and
         come to Pescara... We are waiting for you!<BR><BR>
